## My process

-I first started messing around with the colors and font sizes to get them all correct. after that I look to push everything into a box like the image given. Once I finally did that, 
I added the image of the QR code and messed with it for a while to get it close enough to the edge of the box. Took a while messing with flex-box for the first time and brand new to HTML and CSS but man this was so fun!
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Like mentioned earlier, I am brand new to HTML and CSS and just learned about the very basics of it. 
I learned how styling and how important centering and alignment is. Google was definitely my best friend. Learned FlexBox and man that was a lifesaver really helped me a lot!

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="qrcode">
  <img class="qr" src="images/image-qr-code.png" height="576" width="576" alt="Qrcode"/>
  <h1>Improve your front-end <br>skills by building projects</h1>

  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</section>
```
```css
.qrcode {
  border-radius: 25px;
  border-color: white;
  height: 550px;
  width: 350px;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px grey;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  /*margin: auto;*/
  text-align: center;
  font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma;
}
```

### Continued development

Since this is my first really project I just want to get more comfortable with both HTML and CSS by practice with both. Learning how to do all the styling more effectively.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me learn how Flexbox worked
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped with a lot of styling I did on the page

And of course couldn't have done this without my instructors at Codeup giving me the resources I needed in order to accomplish this task!
